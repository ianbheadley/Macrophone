Create sonic time-lapses from a collection of sounds
A method for realtime playback of audio that has been recorded via Phonolapse (timelapse) recording. Designed specifically for playing back audio recorded using a WildLife Acoustics SONG METER. 
For best results, files should be in the titled in a chronological time sequenced order. The processed files that is records will include 3 channels, 2 channels of playback audio, 1 channel of metadata that indicates the file playing back (think of like a timecode channel).
